RAFT Akka
=========

An experimental implementation of the [RAFT consensus algorithm](https://raftconsensus.github.io/) using Scala and Akka framework. This repo is far from complete. A much better implementation is coming soon ...

If you are looking for a scala implementation, I found [this](https://github.com/ktoso/akka-raft) is a pretty good one, which comes from a contributer of Akka.
